# C++ Projects

# Student Records Database/Directory (WIP)
Student Records Database/Directory is a simple implementation of UCSC's directory listing (https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/).
Currently can add, delete, update, search, and show student listings. 
Uses a SQLite3, a small library for databases in C++, to store student entries.

# Student Records Database/Directory with ncurses (WIP)
Ncurses is a small library that allows for customized console display and outputs to make programs more refined and presentable. The program features are essentially identical with the Student Records Database/Directory.

# To-Do List
Simple implementation of a to-do list. Can add, update, delete, and print out tasks of the to-do list.
