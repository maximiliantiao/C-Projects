# C-Projects
Just a place for my side C/ C++ projects that I do for fun!

# Student Records Database/Directory (WIP)
Student Records Database/Directory is a simple implementation of UCSC's directory listing (https://campusdirectory.ucsc.edu/).
Currently can add, delete, update, and show student listings. 
In the future, will implement search features.

# Student Records Database/Directory with ncurses (WIP)
Ncurses is a small library that allows for customized console display and outputs to make programs more refined and presentable. The program features are essentially identical with the Student Records Database/Directory.
